# Chaos
Basic implementation of chaotic attractor and bifurcation diagram visualization for the Lorenz and Jug attractors.

bifurcation.py: plots bifurcation diagram for the Lorenz system

jug.py: plots jug attractor

lorenz.py: plots Lorenz attractor

chaos.py: (WIP) partially-updated analysis of coupled three-species food chains.
One oscillator begins in a stable state and the other in a chaotic state.
A competition parameter is varied to see how stability is forced upon the chaotic system or chaos onto the stable system.
NOTE: Work-in-progress; figures still need to be improved and are currently unlabelled, and some errors may also still be present.

chaos_old.py: legacy version of chaos.py hastily ported from an old R script
